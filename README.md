## 3. Skills Showcased üõ†Ô∏è

* **Data Transformation (ETL):** Extensive use of **Power Query** (M Language) within Power BI for data cleaning, shaping, and establishing a robust analytical model.
* **Data Querying:** Writing and executing efficient **SQL** queries for initial data extraction and aggregation.
* **Power BI Modeling:** Creation of both **implicit and explicit measures** (using DAX) to define complex KPIs (e.g., Median Revenue, Avg Pizzas per Order).
* **Dashboard Design & Interactivity:** Implementing best practices in dashboard design, utilizing **buttons** for navigation, **slicers**, and **drill-through** functionality between pages.
* **Core Charting:** Effective use of **KPI Cards**, **Line Charts**, **Bar Charts**, **Column Charts**, and **Donut Charts** to communicate diverse insights.

## 4. Analytical Insights & Business Recommendations

* **Operational Peak:** **Friday** is the clear peak day for order volume, requiring maximum resource allocation. **July** was the highest-volume month.
* **Low-Value Segment Diagnostic:** The **Classic** category is high-volume but a low-value segment. The **Median Revenue per Order ($\$14.5$)** is significantly lower than the overall **Avg Customer Spend ($\$38.31$)**, indicating that the majority of sales are for single, lower-priced items.
* **Pricing Strategy:** The Classic category's transaction average $(\approx\$27.76)$ shows these customers spend approximately **\$10 less** per visit, highlighting a strong opportunity for targeted upselling (e.g., suggesting add-ons or bundles) to increase customer spend.
* **Product Focus:** The **Large** size is the dominant contributor to both revenue and sales volume.

## Conclusion

This analysis successfully segmented sales performance, identified immediate operational bottlenecks (Friday and July peaks), and provided actionable data for the pricing team to address the low-value nature of the Classic pizza segment. The dashboard provides a dynamic, single source of truth for all key stakeholders.
